It does not have any fights, nor any deaths involved. However, it rapidly increases the tension all around the world due to the race of military arms between two big countries: the United States and the Soviet Union (formally called Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , or USSR ). Due to no real battle, hence the name \"Cold War\". The \"war\" lasted from 1947 to 1991. Although it increases the tension of a possible WW3, it also pushes both sides with major achievements in space and science. Note 1: There are several arguments on when the war started, but to keep it simplified, we start with the WW2 period. Note 2: To make life easy, whenever I refer to the Blue countries, it usually means the US and Great Britain, while the Red country is the Soviet Union. What happened? Let's recall a bit about the Soviet Union. They followed the ideology of communism , which is basically the work from everyone will be shared equally, not based on their contribution. During the time around 1924, the Soviet Union is dictated under Joseph Stalin 's rule. The importance here is because Joseph Stalin is a dictator, the world view communism as a threat to democracy . During WW2, the United States was wary of Soviet communism and concerned about Joseph's tyrannical rule. The Soviets were also pissed because America didn't treat them as an international country, and also because the US didn't join the war earlier, their country suffered millions of deaths. So from the start, the US and the Soviets didn't like each other , but they formed an alliance anyway to stop Germany. From left to right: Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin After defeating Germany, the Allies started to decide which country in Europe they would rule, because they won the battle, and like the ancient way of war: if you win, you conquer the loser. The Soviets took Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Albania, and East Germany . Note the East here, because Germany is divided into two parts, East Germany and West Germany , with Berlin (Germany's capital) is divided once more into East Berlin and West Berlin . Due to the USSR's expansion to Europe after the war, the US feared they would take over the world . While the USSR was pissed because they thought the US was trying to stop them from forming relationships worldwide and recovering from war. On March 5, 1946, Winston Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech , with the purpose of forming a close relationship with the US, but also warning about the expansion of the Soviets. It essentially considered a curtain in Europe, and the second part of Europe and East Germany belongs to communism. Of course, the speech was well-received by the US (not the good relationship though, the one with the curtain ._.), and Stalin didn't like the speech. Winston Churchill gave the Iron Curtain speech How the \"war\" happened? The Containment (Mar 1947) Fear of the Soviet expansion, Harry S. Truman issued a Truman Doctrine , which aids Greece and Turkey in fighting against the spread of communism . Most people believe this is when the Cold War started. Followed up with the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan also provided Europe money to build up their economy from shamble because of WW2 . This basically means these countries are under America's influence. They include France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, and West Germany . The USSR did the same for its countries, under the Molotov Plan . The Berlin Blockade (June 1948 - May 1949) In 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access from the outside to West Berlin (Berlin is inside East Germany, that's why they had to split), which would essentially drain the West Berlin resource from America and Great Britain. This is called the Berlin Blockade . In response, the Blue countries and France set up a Berlin Airlift . If the Berlin Blockade blocks the ground, then they can just go through the air. It is set up in West Germany, and the Blue countries with France periodically send supplies to West Berlin. Stalin eventually removed the blockade, but it was the first conflict in the Cold War . The Berlin Blockade and the Berlin Airlift The Arms Race A bit more subtle method to sort of \"threaten\" the Soviet Union from America is to build more armies . After the atomic bomb, America gotta be the last country you want to mess with. Thus, America joins with other Western European countries to form NATO (or North Atlantic Treaty Organization ) in 1949 to essentially say \"if the Soviet mess with one of us, they're messing with ALL of us\". Do you think the Soviet is not gonna mess with them? NO. Well, they indirectly mess with them by successfully launch an atomic bomb . Now if your enemy has a similar weapon as yours, what are you gonna do to defend? Obviously by having even MORE weapons than them . So both the US and the Soviet Union involves in an arms race . The world was not even at war, but the tension between the two countries made it sounds like if one side pops, the world would explode . In 1955, the USSR essentially created a group that's like NATO, called the Warsaw Pact to protect its countries from the US. The Arms race People want freedom Under the Soviet Union's rule, some European countries didn't like their conditions (remember, the resources are shared among everyone, thus a lot of people were in barely livable condition). And now they look at the West. Woah, they can say anything, they have resources from other countries. So naturally, people want to get out of Soviet's control to get that sweet treatment. Of course, the Soviets didn't want that to happen. After protests in Hungary, the USSR sent armies to invade and end the rebellion in 1956. Also in 1968, the Soviets once again sent armies to Czechoslovakia to end the rebellion again . These two invasions eventually make many countries under Red's influence pissed, and eventually, they tried to break out of the Warsaw Pact. During that period, East Berlin also wanted to go to West Berlin . So the USSR built a wall around West Berlin, usually referred to as the Berlin Wall , which is literally a long wall with watchtowers to kill whoever tries to pass the wall. The Berlin Wall under construction Cuban Missile Crisis (Oct 1962) Due to both superpowers keep developing weapons, they now have ICBM , which stands for InterContinental Ballistic Missiles . Basically, they have a missile that can shoot across countries and have a specific target. The USSR secretly installed them in Cuba to launch to the US. In return, Fidel Castro , leader of Cuba, asked the Soviets for protection from the US, because he had the same ideology. John F. Kennedy , the president of the United States, issued a blockade to Cuba while a ship was traveling to Cuba. A friendly reminder that both nations had developed tons of weapons to the point that a small conflict can start an atomic war. It luckily returned, but it didn't solve the missile problem. Eventually, JFK and Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in Cuba, in exchange to remove the missiles in Turkey. Space Race (1955) The two superpowers didn't just have a race on weapons. They also had a race to space . The Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite into space . The Americans didn't like that, and the Soviet Union casually launched the first man into space in April 1961. Americans didn't like that at all, so besides launching the first American into space, they also successfully step on the moon for the first time (yes, Neil Armstrong ) in 1969, effectively won the space race. American Astronauts on the moon during the space race The SALT (1979) During Richard Nixon 's presidency, he adopted a policy of D\u00e9tente , which ease the tension between America and the Soviet Union . He encouraged the United Nations to recognize the communist China government and established a relationship with them in 1972. In the same year, Nixon and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty , or SALT , which lower the number of nuclear bombs the countries own . The end of an era (Dec 1991) When Mikhail Gorbachev became the USSR leader, it was a turning point. He introduced two policies: Glasnost , or political openness , and Perestroika , or economic reform . These policies essentially weakened the dictatorship all previous USSR leaders built, and combined with the uproar from Hungary and Czechoslovakia, other countries started to replace their government with a noncommunist government. Finally, in November 1989, the Berlin Wall - the most visible symbol of the Cold War - had finally torn down. By 1991, the Soviet Union fell apart, putting an end to the Cold War . The Fall of the Berlin Wall Affect on people The Cold War affects everyone in the world, including the Americans themselves. At around the 1950s, a hysteria rose that the evil communism had entered America. This caused people to constantly anxious and targeting other people for being Red. This is called the Red Scare , and we sometimes hear the word McCarthyism , because it talks about the baseless accusation of some government officials being Red. Not only the Red Scare, the American and generally people around the world fear of a nuclear war. This is at stake during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Red Scare Meanwhile, in Asia... The two superpowers also try to get some countries in Asia to their influence. This includes Korea and Vietnam , creating major wars. The Korean War (June 1950 - present) At the end of WW2, Korea is divided into two occupations. The Soviets administered the northern half and America administered the southern half . As a result of the Cold War, these two parts became sovereign states. The government on both sides claimed all Korea was theirs, so the war to gain land back began. In summary, after several battles to get the land back, the 38th parallel once again their borders, marking the DMZ ( Demilitarized Zone ). The problem is, they didn't sign a peace treaty. It was more of a cease-fire. The 38th parallel, also the border between two countries The Vietnam War (Nov 1955 - Apr 1975) Note that the view can be biased here, due to how it was taught in Vietnam . The problem started France invaded Vietnam. After WW2, Northern Vietnam was ruled as a communist country, and Southern Vietnam , under France and later on America, was ruled more similar to the West. After driving France off the country in 1954, the Geneva conference temporarily divided the country into two parts along the 17th parallel. It sought reunification in 1956, but in 1955, an anti-communist politician Ngo Dinh Diem seize power from the South to become the president of Southern Vietnam. The 17th parallel, also the border between two countries After deadly battles, including the use of many cruel weapons such as drugs, the war ended with Northern Vietnam as the winner. Throughout the war, Southern Vietnam was supplied by America to prevent a country from falling Red , known as the Domino Theory .

At first, it is like a war everyone knows, but after a while, it became a long stall. The war started on Sep 11, 2001, and is still ongoing. The \"war\" added a huge debt to the US, and many critics asserted the \"war\" is not gonna end by military uses. Note: Because how the war is repetitive in a way, the conclusion section is a bit informative. What happened? Let's go back to before the 9/11 terrorist attack , which involves the Taliban and Osama bin Laden , the leader of al Qaeda . Taliban is a fundamentalism movement that has a religious motivation to make society pure. They are the unrecognized government of Afghanistan during the period. Osama bin Laden is the founder of al-Qaeda, which is a terrorist group based in Afghanistan . For quite a time, both the Taliban and bin Laden doesn't like America. In fact, they hate the Western in general. This has to do with their ideology and several interferences from the past such as the Persian Gulf War and the West's support in Israel, their enemy. Eventually, this became the motive for bin Laden to attack the United States. On Sep 11, 2001, al-Qaeda hijacked 4 airplanes and flew 3 of them towards the World Trade Center and the Pentagon . The 4th one was heading towards Washington DC when it redirected to crash in Pennsylvania. This caused almost 3000 people to die (not including the 19 hijackers). The attack caused trauma to many Americans. The second plane flying to the second tower of the World Trade Center In a speech on Sep 20, President George W. Bush told that the terrorists attacked America because they hate freedom . In the speech, he also announced the Bush Doctrine , which stated that America will go to war with terrorism, including countries that support them . Note that \"terrorism\" does not just stop at al-Qaeda. Bush also said \"Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated. \" How the war happened? The Afghanistan War On Oct 7, 2001, America and Great Britain performed air attacks in Afghanistan at Taliban and al-Qaeda training camps, officially starting the Afghanistan War . The operation is called Operation Enduring Freedom . From then on to mid-2002, America took down the Taliban and put up a new democratically elected president for Afghanistan. However, the Taliban still managed to rise back and stall the war up to the present. The Iraq War In March 2003, the US and its coalition force invade Iraq because there was intelligence that Iraq and its dictator, Saddam Hussein , possessed/developed weapons of mass destruction. However, no evidence of a relationship between Saddam Hussein and bin Laden was found, nor the weapons of mass destruction. Although Operation Iraqi Freedom completed quickly, al-Qaeda-affiliated groups surged and created many casualties to the coalition, which made the war a little bit longer. On Dec 30, 2006, Saddam Hussein was executed. On Dec 18, 2011, the United States completed its withdrawal under Barack Obama 's administration. Timeline of the Iraq War Death of Osama bin Laden In July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence that determined what they believed to be bin Laden's hiding place. When presented to Obama, he rejected the idea of bombing the compound, but to perform a surgical raid by the US Navy SEALs . The raid successfully finished in about 40 minutes. Osama bin Laden is buried in the ocean within 24 hours, following the Muslim religious rites. The compound bin Laden hid during the raid The rise of ISIS ISIS is a group that emerged from the remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq. The group was found in 2004 but emerged in 2011. It is exactly because of these groups that make the War on Terror in the Middle East last until the present. By December 2017, ISIS had lost 95% of its territory, but they still keep on attacking and carrying attacks around the world. Conclusion In general, the war started with the 9/11 attack, in an attempt to clear out the terrorist groups, mostly in the Middle East. However, although getting bombed and raided through many operations, the al Qaeda still managed to attack several places around the world, which made the war last even longer. However, this war had received many criticisms, notably on morals, ethics, and economies. During the war, many civilians have been killed due to many bombings. Islams are generally disliked, and finally, the war costs a huge amount of money.

However, although getting bombed and raided through many operations, the al Qaeda still managed to attack several places around the world, which made the war last even longer. However, this war had received many criticisms, notably on morals, ethics, and economies. During the war, many civilians have been killed due to many bombings. Islams are generally disliked, and finally, the war costs a huge amount of money.

It is considered to be the deadliest international war in history , with about 60 to 80 million deaths, including 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust (very tragic event). In World War II, there are two sides: the Axis (you can consider this as the antagonist team) and the Allies (you can consider this as the protagonist team). Note: You can read more about Holocaust online. This webpage won't include it. What happened? It all started after World War I (or The Great War), with Germany was the losing side. Of course, because Germany was the losing side, it had to give money to the winning side to fix their countries, and along with The Great Depression , caused Germany's economy to be destabilized. Because Germany was blamed as the losing side, the Versailles Treaty hit Germany hard. Although it was supposed to be a peace treaty (which did end the war), the conditions the Allies placed upon Germany were so harsh that it caused anger from German. These basically made rise to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi). When Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, it was basically when he can control the country. His basic idea was to have a pure German race , and war is the only way to obtain more land for the German master race to live . And thus, he started violating the Versailles Treaty and brought armies to Austria , and annexed Czechoslovakia . Nobody really care, until the war happened. Meanwhile, Japan was invading other countries in Asia , because they thought they were superior to all, it had the strongest army and navy in Asia, and its economic condition wasn't good. How the war happened? Germany's Invasion (Sep 1939) In July 1937, Japan invaded China and started World War II in Asia (\" Pacific War \") However, it's not really the main cause for the conflict to happen. In late August 1939, Hitler and Joseph Stalin signed a non-aggression pact, which means they will remain neutral. And they invaded Poland . Because Great Britain and France promised military support for Poland , on September 3, 1939, they both declared war on Germany, beginning World War 2. After Poland, Germany just swept through Europe (\"Blitzkrieg\"), forcing Britain and France to back up. To make things worse, in Italy , a new fascist dictator Benito Mussolini formed an alliance with Hitler and declared war against France and Britain. Germany's soldiers marching The Battle of Britain (Sep 1940 - May 1941) Eventually, only Britain remained, with the only reason was the English Channel separated Britain from Europe. So German planes just bombed Britain continuously from September 1940 to May 1941 (\"Blitz\") and hoped it would be easy. It was so WRONG. The Prime Minister of Britain at the time, Winston Churchill was determined to defend Britain at all cost, and with his speech, the morale of the British increased. Eventually, the air force of Britain managed to push back the air force of Germany, forcing Hitler to postpone the Britain invasion. This is referred to as the Battle of Britain , which considered to be a turning point in WW2 because it's the first time Germany retreated. Hawker Hurricanes of No. 85 Squadron, Royal Air Force Invading Soviet Union (June 1941) Because the original plan of Hitler is to obtain more land for the German master race , and the Soviet Union is just a huge vast amount of land, Hitler began to invade the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. This is referred to as Operation Barbarossa . It did succeed at first, but after failing to capture Leningrad , winter came . Not familiar with the weather condition and the lack of supplies, the Soviets finally pushed back with the Battle of Moscow and defeated the German with the Battle of Stalingrad . The invasion ended up depleting a lot of Germany's strength. The US Joins the War (Dec 1941) Back when Japan was invading China, the United States already tried to stop their expansion by placing economic sanctions, which raise the tension between the two even higher. And Japan doesn't like this one scenario: the US will actually bring their armies to stop Japan. So they attacked Pearl Harbor surprisingly on Dec 7, 1941. It did catch the American off guard, which killed more than 2300 American troops. After this event, America joined World War II . In June 1942, America successfully won the Battle of Midway , which is a huge turning point in the Pacific, because, from that point on, Japan is in a defensive move. Pearl Harbor during the attack The Allies Strike Back (1943 - May 1945) In North Africa, British and American forces defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. They then invade Italy, and Mussolini's government fell in July 1943 . On June 6, 1944 (\" D-Day \") the Allies began a massive invasion and deployed troops in the beach of France. Hitler did use all his army's strength to defend, but the Soviet troops also invade Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania . Facing the attacks from two sides again like World War I, Germany formally surrendered on May 8, 1945 . Hitler committed suicide earlier on. Defeat of Japan (Sep 1945) Once the Allies is done with Italy and Germany, only Japan remained. Through capturing many essential islands near Japan (the most famous one is Iwo Jima , with its Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photo) and the counterattack from China, Japan now only has its mainland left. Due to American casualties after the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa , the President of the United States authorized the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan.
