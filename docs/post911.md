# The Current War on Terror

The Current War on Terror (also called the **War on Terror**) is a long war that is still ongoing today. At first, it is like a war everyone knows, but after a while, it became a long stall.

The war started on Sep 11, 2001, and is still ongoing. The "war" added a huge debt to the US, and many critics asserted the "war" is not gonna end by military uses.

*Note: Because how the war is repetitive in a way, the conclusion section is a bit informative.*

## What happened?

Let's go back to before the __9/11 terrorist attack__, which involves the ***Taliban*** and ***Osama bin Laden***, the leader of ***al-Qaeda***.

Taliban is a __fundamentalism__ movement that has a religious motivation to make society pure. They are the unrecognized government of Afghanistan during the period. Osama bin Laden is the founder of al-Qaeda, which is a terrorist group based in ***Afghanistan***. For quite a time, both the Taliban and bin Laden doesn't like America. In fact, **they hate the Western** in general. This has to do with their ideology and several interferences from the past such as the *Persian Gulf War* and the West's support in Israel, their enemy. Eventually, this became the motive for bin Laden to attack the United States.

On Sep 11, 2001, al-Qaeda hijacked 4 airplanes and flew 3 of them towards the *World Trade Center* and the *Pentagon*. The 4th one was heading towards Washington DC when it redirected to crash in Pennsylvania. This caused almost 3000 people to die (not including the 19 hijackers). The attack caused trauma to many Americans.

In a speech on Sep 20, President ***George W. Bush*** told that the terrorists attacked America because *they hate freedom*. In the speech, he also announced the **Bush Doctrine**, which stated that **America will go to war with terrorism, including countries that support them**. Note that "terrorism" does not just stop at al-Qaeda. Bush also said "Our war on terror begins with al-Qaeda, but it does not end there. **It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.**"

## How the war happened?

### The Afghanistan War

On Oct 7, 2001, America and Great Britain performed air attacks in Afghanistan at Taliban and al-Qaeda training camps, officially starting the **Afghanistan War**. The operation is called **Operation Enduring Freedom**.

From then on to mid-2002, America took down the Taliban and put up a new democratically elected president for Afghanistan. However, the Taliban still managed to rise back and stall the war up to the present.

### The Iraq War

In March 2003, the US and its coalition force invade Iraq because there was intelligence that Iraq and its dictator, *Saddam Hussein*, **possessed/developed weapons of mass destruction**. However, no evidence of a relationship between Saddam Hussein and bin Laden was found, nor the weapons of mass destruction.

Although **Operation Iraqi Freedom** completed quickly, al-Qaeda-affiliated groups surged and created many casualties to the coalition, which made the war a little bit longer.

On Dec 30, 2006, Saddam Hussein was executed. On Dec 18, 2011, the United States completed its withdrawal under ***Barack Obama***'s administration.

### Death of Osama bin Laden

In July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence that determined what they believed to be bin Laden's hiding place. When presented to Obama, he rejected the idea of bombing the compound, but to perform a surgical raid by the *US Navy SEALs*. The raid successfully finished in about 40 minutes.

Osama bin Laden is buried in the ocean within 24 hours, following the Muslim religious rites.

### The rise of ISIS

***ISIS*** is a group that emerged from the remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq. The group was found in 2004 but emerged in 2011. It is exactly because of these groups that make the War on Terror in the Middle East last until the present.

By December 2017, ISIS had lost 95% of its territory, but they still keep on attacking and carrying attacks around the world.

## Conclusion

In general, the war started with the 9/11 attack, in an attempt to clear out the terrorist groups, mostly in the Middle East. However, although getting bombed and raided through many operations, **the al-Qaeda still managed to exist and attack several places around the world, which made the war last even longer**.

However, this war had received many criticisms, notably on morals, ethics, and economies. During the war, **many civilians have been killed due to many bombings. Islams are generally disliked, and finally, the war costs a huge amount of money**.
