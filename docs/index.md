# American Government Final Project

Welcome to this page, if you happen to ever come across that is. Although this page is hosted on Github, this page has nothing to do with code and is only served for a student's project, because he's too lazy messing with google site, and Weebly isn't that good to separate headings. Using markdown and mkdocs, it is simple enough to make things work with only a keyboard and Internet access.

Anyway, in short, my name is Bach Ngo. As the website's title stated, this is for the American Government's Final Project. It contains simplified information about the three big war throughout history, which are the following:
