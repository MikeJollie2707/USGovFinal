# Main Page

Welcome to this page, if you happen to ever come across that is. Although this page is hosted on github, this page has nothing to do with code, and is only served for a student's project, because he's too lazy messing with google site, and weebly isn't that good to separate headings.

Anyway, in short, this is a very simple webpage that will contains researched information about the three big war throughout the history, which are the following:

- [World War II](ww2.md)
- [The Cold War](coldwar.md)
- [Post 9/11 War](post911.md)

Few things to note:

- ***Bold and italic***: An important location or character.
- *Italic*: A less important location or piece of information.
- **Bold**: An important historical event or piece of information.

That's it for the main page, click on one of those links above.
