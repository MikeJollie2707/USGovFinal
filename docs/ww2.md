# World War II

World War II is a huge war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It is considered to be the **deadliest international war in history**, with about 60 to 80 million deaths, including 6 million Jews died to the Holocaust (very tragic event).

In World War II, there are two sides: the Axis (you can consider this as the antagonist team) and the Allies (you can consider this as the protagonist team).

*Note: You can read more about Holocaust online. This webpage won't include it.*

## What happened?

It all started after World War I (or The Great War), with ***Germany*** was the losing side. Of course, because Germany was the losing side, it had to give money to the winning side to fix their countries, and along with *The Great Depression*, caused **Germany's economy to be destabilized.**

Because Germany was blamed as the losing side, the Versailles Treaty hit Germany hard. Although it was supposed to be a peace treaty (which it did end the war), the conditions the Allies placed upon Germany was harsh that **it caused anger from German.**

These basically made rise to ***Adolf Hitler*** and the **National Socialist German Workers' Party** (Nazi). When Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, it was basically when he can control the country. His basic idea was to have **pure German race**, and **war is the only way to obtain more land for German master race to live**.

And thus, he started violating the Versailles Treaty and brought armies to *Austria* and annexed *Czechoslovakia*. Nobody really care, until the war happened.

Meanwhile, ***Japan*** was invading other countries in *Asia*, because they thought they were superior to all, it had the strongest army and navy in Asia, and its economic condition wasn't good.

## How the war happened?

### Germany's Invasion (Sep 1939)

On July 1937, Japan invaded *China* and started World War II in Asia ("**Pacific War**")

However, it's not the really main cause for the conflict to happen. In late August 1939, Hitler and ***Joseph Stalin***, signed a nonaggression pact, which means they will remain neutral. And __they invaded Poland__. Because ***Great Britain*** and ***France*** promised military support for *Poland*, on September 3 1939, they both **declared war on Germany, beginning World War 2.**

After Poland, Germany just *swept* through Europe ("Blitzkrieg"), forcing Britain and France to back up. To make things worse, in ***Italy***, a new fascist dictator ***Benito Mussolini*** formed an alliance with Hitler, and declared war against France and Britain.

### The Battle of Britain (Sep 1940 - May 1941)

Eventually, only Britain remained, with the only reason was the English Channel separated Britain with the Europe. So Germany planes just bombed Britain continuously in September 1940 to May 1941 ("Blitz"), and hoped it would be easy.

It was so WRONG. The Prime Minister of Britain at the time, ***Winston Churchill*** was determined to defend Britain at all cost, and with his speech, the morale of British increased. Eventually, the air force of Britain managed to push back the air force of Germany, forcing Hitler to postpone Britain invasion. This is referred to as the **battle of Britain**, which considered to be a turning point in WW2, because it's the first time Germany retreated.

### Invading Soviet Union (June 1941)

Because the original plan of Hitler is *to obtain more land for the German master race*, and the ***Soviet Union*** is just a huge vast amount of lands, Hitler began to invade the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. This is referred to as **Operation Barbarossa**. It did success at first, but after failing to capture *Leningrad*, *winter came*.

Not familiar with the weather condition and the lack of supplies, the Soviets finally pushed back with the **Battle of Moscow**, and defeated the German with the **Battle of Stalingrad**. The invasion ended up depleting a lot of Germany's strength.

### The US Joins the War (Dec 1941)

Back when Japan was invading China, the United States already tried to stop their expansion by placing economic sanctions, which raise the tension between the two even higher. And Japan doesn't like this one scenario: the US will actually bring their armies to stop Japan. So **they attacked Pearl Harbor surprisingly** on Dec 7, 1941.

It did caught the American off guard, which killed more than 2300 American troops. **After this event, America joined World War II**.

In June 1942, America successfully won the **Battle of Midway**, which is a huge turning point in the Pacific, because from that point on, Japan is in a defensive move.

### The Allies Strike Back (1943 - May 1945)

In North Africa, British and Americans forces defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. They then invade Italy, and **Mussolini's government fell in July 1943**.

On June 6, 1944 ("**D-Day**") the Allies began a massive invasion and deployed troops in the beach of France. Hitler did use all his armies strength to defend, but the Soviet troops also invade *Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania*. Facing the attacks from two sides again like World War I, **Germany formally surrendered on May 8, 1945**. Hitler committed suicide earlier on.

### Defeat of Japan (Sep 1945)

Once the Allies done with Italy and Germany, only Japan remained. Through capturing many essential islands near Japan (the most famous one is *Iwo Jima*, with its *Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima* photo) and the counterattack from China, Japan now only has its mainland left.

Due to American casualties after *Battle of Iwo Jima* and *Battle of Okinowa*, the President of the United States authorized the use of atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan. The impact was huge. Japan admittedly surrendered.
