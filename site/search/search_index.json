It does not have any fights, nor any deaths involved. However, it rapidly increases the tension all around the world due to the race of military arms between two big countries: the United States and the Soviet Union . Due to no real battle, hence the name \"Cold War\". The \"war\" lasted from 1947 to 1991. Although it increases the tension of a possible WW3, it also pushes both sides with major achievements in space and science. Note: There are several arguments on when the war started, but to keep it simplified, we start with WW2 period. Note 2: To make life easy, whenever I refer to the Blue countries, it usually means the US and Great Britain, while the Red country is the Soviet Union. What happened? Context Let's recall a bit about the Soviet Union. They followed the ideology of communism* , which is basically the work from everyone will be shared equally, not based on their contribution. During the time around 1924, the Soviet Union is dictated under Joseph Stalin* rule. The importance here is because Joseph Stalin is a dictator, the world view communism as a threat to democracy . After WW2 During WW2, the United States was wary of Soviet communism and concerned about Joseph's tyrannical rule. The Soviets were also pissed because America didn't treat them as an international country, and also because the US didn't join the war earlier, their country suffered millions of deaths. So from the start, the US and the Soviet didn't like each other , but they formed an alliance anyway to stop Germany. After defeating Germany, the Allies started to decide which country in Europe they would rule, because they won the battle, and like the ancient way of war: if you win, you conquer the loser. The Soviet took Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Albania and East Germany . Note the East here, because Germany is divided into two parts, East Germany and West Germany , with Berlin (Germany's capital) is divided once more into East Berlin and West Berlin . Due to the USSR's expansion to the Europe after the war, the US feared they would take over the world . While the USSR was pissed because they thought the US was trying to stop them from forming relationships worldwide and recovering from war. On March 5, 1946, Winston Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech , with the purpose of forming a close relationship with the US, but also warning about the expansion of the Soviets. It essentially considered a curtain in Europe, and the second part of Europe and East Germany belongs to communism. Of course, the speech was well-received by the US (not the good relationship though, the one with the curtain ._.), and Stalin didn't like the speech. The Containment Fear of the Soviet expansion, Harry S. Truman issued a Truman Doctrine , which aid Greece and Turkey to fight against the spread of communism . Most people believe this is when the Cold War started. Followed up with Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan also provided Europe money to build up their economy from shamble because of WW2 . This basically means these countries are under America's influence. They include: France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland and West Germany . The USSR did the same for its countries, under the Molotov Plan . The Berlin Blockade On 1948, the Soviet Union blocked accesses from the outside to West Berlin (Berlin is inside East Germany, that's why they had to split), which would essentially drain the West Berlin resource from America and Great Britain. This is called the Berlin Blockade . In response, the Blue countries and France setup a Berlin Airlift . If the Berlin Blockade blocks the ground, then they can just go through air. It is setup in West Germany, and the Blue countries with France periodically send supplies to West Berlin. Stalin eventually removed the blockade, but it was the first conflict in the Cold War . The Bomb, again A bit more subtle method to sort of \"threaten\" the Soviet Union from America is to build more armies . After the atomic bomb, America gotta be the last country you want to mess with. Thus, America joins with other Western Europe countries to form NATO (or North Atlantic Treaty Organization ) in 1949 to essentially say \"if the Soviet mess with one of us, they're messing with ALL of us\". You think the Soviet is not gonna mess with them? NO. Well, they indirectly mess with them by successfully launch an atomic bomb . Now if your enemy have a similar weapon as yours, what are you gonna do to defend? Obviously by having even MORE weapons than them . So both the US and the Soviet Union involves in an arms race . The world is not even in war, but the tension between the two countries make it sounds like if one side pops, the world will explode . In 1955, the USSR essentially creates a group that's like NATO, called the Warsaw Pact to protect its countries from the US. People like freedom Under Soviet Union's rule, some Europe countries didn't like their conditions (remember, the resources are shared among everyone, thus a lot of people were in barely livable condition). And now they look at the West. Woa, they can say anything, they have resources from other countries. So naturally, people want to get out of Soviet's control to get that sweet treatment. Of course, the Soviet didn't want that to happen. After protests in Hungary, the USSR sent armies to invade and end the rebellion in 1956. Also in 1968, the Soviet once again sent armies to Czechoslovakia to end the rebellion again . These two invasions eventually make many countries under Red's influence pissed, and eventually they tried to break out of the Warsaw Pact. During that period, East Berlin also wanted to go to West Berlin . So the USSR built a wall around West Berlin, usually referred as the Berlin Wall , which is literally a long wall with watch towers to kill whoever try to pass the wall. Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) Due to both superpowers keep developing weapons, they now have ICBM* , which stands for InterContinental Ballistic Missiles . Basically they have a missile that can shoot across countries and have a specific target. The USSR secretly installed them in Cuba to launch to the US. In return, Fidel Castro***, leader of Cuba, asked the Soviet for protection from the US, because he had the same ideology. John F. Kennedy , the president of the United States, issued a blockade to Cuba while a ship was travelling to Cuba. A friendly reminder that both nations had developed a tons of weapons to the point that a small conflict can start an atomic war. It luckily returned, but it didn't solve the missile problem. Eventually, JFK and Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in Cuba, in exchange to remove the missiles in Turkey. Space The two superpowers didn't just have a race on weapons. They also had a race to space . The Soviet Union successfully launched the Sputnik, the first man-made satellite into space . The American didn't like that, and the Soviet Union casually launched the first man into space on April 1961. Americans didn't like that at all, so besides launching the first American into space, they also successfully step on the moon for the first time (yes, Neil Armstrong ) in 1969, effectively won the space race. SALTy During Richard Nixon 's presidency, he adopted a policy of D\u00e9tente , which ease the tension between America and Soviet Union . He encouraged the United Nations to recognize the communist China government and established relationship with them in 1972. In the same year, Nixon and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty , or SALT , which lower the number of nuclear bombs the countries own . The end of an era When Mikhail Gorbachev became the USSR leader, it was a turning point. He introduced two policies: Glasnost , or political openness , and Perestroika , or economic reform . These policies essentially weakened the dictatorship all previous USSR leaders built, and combined with the uproar from Hungary and Czechoslovakia, other countries started to replace their government with noncommunist government. Finally, on November 1989, the Berlin Wall - the most visible symbol of the Cold War - had finally teared down. By 1991, the Soviet Union fallen apart, putting an end to the Cold War . Affect on people The Cold War affects everyone in the world, including the Americans themselves. At around 1950s, a hysteria rose that the evil communism had entered America. This caused people to constantly anxious and targeting other people of being Red. This is called the Red Scare , and we sometimes hear the word McCarthyism , because it talks about the baseless accusation of some government officials being Red. Not only the Red Scare, the American and generally people around the world fear of a nuclear war. This is at stake during the Cuba Missile Crisis. Meanwhile, in Asia... The two superpowers also try to get some countries in Asia to their influence. This includes Korea and Vietnam , creating major wars. The Korean War At the end of WW2, Korea is divided in two occupations. The Soviet administered the northern half and the America administered the southern half . As a result of the Cold War, these two parts became sovereign states. The government on both sides claimed all Korea was theirs, so the war to gain land back began. In summary, after several battles to get the land back, the 38th parallel once again their borders, marking the DMZ ( Demilitarized Zone ). The problem is, they didn't sign a peace treaty. It was more of a cease fire. The Vietnam War Note that the view can be biased here, due to how it was taught in Vietnam . The problem started from France when they invaded Vietnam. After WW2, the Northern Vietnam was ruled as a communist country, and Southern Vietnam , under France and later on America, was ruled more similar to the West. After driving France off the country in 1954, the Geneva conference temporarily divided the country into two parts along the 17th parallel. It seek for reunification in 1956, but in 1955, an anti-communist politician Ngo Dinh Diem seize power from the South to become the president of Southern Vietnam. After deadly battles, including the use of many cruel weapons such as drugs, the war ended with Northern Vietnam as the winner. Throughout the war, Southern Vietnam was supplied by America to prevent a country falling Red , known as the Domino Theory .

It is considered to be the deadliest international war in history , with about 60 to 80 million deaths, including 6 million Jews died to the Holocaust (very tragic event). In World War II, there are two sides: the Axis (you can consider this as the antagonist team) and the Allies (you can consider this as the protagonist team). Note: You can read more about Holocaust online. This webpage won't include it. What happened? It all started after World War I (or The Great War), with Germany was the losing side. Of course, because Germany was the losing side, it had to give money to the winning side to fix their countries, and along with The Great Depression , caused Germany's economy to be destabilized. Because Germany was blamed as the losing side, the Versailles Treaty hit Germany hard. Although it was supposed to be a peace treaty (which it did end the war), the conditions the Allies placed upon Germany was harsh that it caused anger from German. These basically made rise to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi). When Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, it was basically when he can control the country. His basic idea was to have pure German race , and war is the only way to obtain more land for German master race to live . And thus, he started violating the Versailles Treaty and brought armies to Austria and annexed Czechoslovakia . Nobody really care, until the war happened. Meanwhile, Japan was invading other countries in Asia , because they thought they were superior to all, it had the strongest army and navy in Asia, and its economic condition wasn't good. How the war happened? Germany's Invasion (Sep 1939) On July 1937, Japan invaded China and started World War II in Asia (\" Pacific War \") However, it's not the really main cause for the conflict to happen. In late August 1939, Hitler and Joseph Stalin , signed a nonaggression pact, which means they will remain neutral. And they invaded Poland . Because Great Britain and France promised military support for Poland , on September 3 1939, they both declared war on Germany, beginning World War 2. After Poland, Germany just swept through Europe (\"Blitzkrieg\"), forcing Britain and France to back up. To make things worse, in Italy , a new fascist dictator Benito Mussolini formed an alliance with Hitler, and declared war against France and Britain. Germany's soldiers marching The Battle of Britain (Sep 1940 - May 1941) Eventually, only Britain remained, with the only reason was the English Channel separated Britain with the Europe. So Germany planes just bombed Britain continuously in September 1940 to May 1941 (\"Blitz\"), and hoped it would be easy. It was so WRONG. The Prime Minister of Britain at the time, Winston Churchill was determined to defend Britain at all cost, and with his speech, the morale of British increased. Eventually, the air force of Britain managed to push back the air force of Germany, forcing Hitler to postpone Britain invasion. This is referred to as the battle of Britain , which considered to be a turning point in WW2, because it's the first time Germany retreated. Hawker Hurricanes of No. 85 Squadron, Royal Air Force Invading Soviet Union (June 1941) Because the original plan of Hitler is to obtain more land for the German master race , and the Soviet Union is just a huge vast amount of lands, Hitler began to invade the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. This is referred to as Operation Barbarossa . It did success at first, but after failing to capture Leningrad , winter came . Not familiar with the weather condition and the lack of supplies, the Soviets finally pushed back with the Battle of Moscow , and defeated the German with the Battle of Stalingrad . The invasion ended up depleting a lot of Germany's strength. The US Joins the War (Dec 1941) Back when Japan was invading China, the United States already tried to stop their expansion by placing economic sanctions, which raise the tension between the two even higher. And Japan doesn't like this one scenario: the US will actually bring their armies to stop Japan. So they attacked Pearl Harbor surprisingly on Dec 7, 1941. It did caught the American off guard, which killed more than 2300 American troops. After this event, America joined World War II . In June 1942, America successfully won the Battle of Midway , which is a huge turning point in the Pacific, because from that point on, Japan is in a defensive move. Pearl Harbor during the attack The Allies Strike Back (1943 - May 1945) In North Africa, British and Americans forces defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. They then invade Italy, and Mussolini's government fell in July 1943 . On June 6, 1944 (\" D-Day \") the Allies began a massive invasion and deployed troops in the beach of France. Hitler did use all his armies strength to defend, but the Soviet troops also invade Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania . Facing the attacks from two sides again like World War I, Germany formally surrendered on May 8, 1945 . Hitler committed suicide earlier on. Defeat of Japan (Sep 1945) Once the Allies done with Italy and Germany, only Japan remained. Through capturing many essential islands near Japan (the most famous one is Iwo Jima , with its Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photo) and the counterattack from China, Japan now only has its mainland left. Due to American casualties after Battle of Iwo Jima and Battle of Okinowa , the President of the United States authorized the use of atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan.
